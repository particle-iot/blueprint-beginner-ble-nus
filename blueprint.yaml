introduction: |
  Turn a Particle device into a BLE peripheral using the Nordic UART Service (NUS). Connect from a phone or another central to send and receive data over a serial-like link.
description: |
  This tutorial implements the Nordic UART Service (NUS) on a Particle device with BLE. The device advertises as "Particle-NUS"; a central can write to the RX characteristic (data is printed to Serial) and subscribe to the TX characteristic to receive periodic notifications. It demonstrates BLE advertising, BleCharacteristic (NOTIFY and WRITE), and the standard NUS UUIDs.
